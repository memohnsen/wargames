# War Games

War Games is an Olympic Weightlifting competition simulator developed from the Staff Calls of Power & Grace Performance by Maddisen Mohnsen

War Games was developed to give both beginner and advanced coaches the ability to practice counting attempts without the stress of a true competition environment. This program is built specifically to be run on your desktop. It will work on mobile devices but is not optimized for that.

- Key Features 
	- The program includes 11 athletes competing in the 96kg weight class who are hitting numbers similar to an American Open Series B-D session. 
	- Each attempt has a different success rate matching the results of the most recent 2024 Nationals using data from https://liftoracle.com/ to get these results. The first attempt has a 75% chance of success, 60% for the second attempt, and 50% for the third attempt.
	- Upon a made lift, athletes will automatically increase between 3-5kg for their next attempt. This applies to your player as well. You may adjust the number you take for your next attempt, but it is recommended to follow the automatic increase in order to keep the counts accurate. 
	- Upon a missed lift, there is a 10% chance that an athlete will go up by 1kg.
	- Users will be able to see all attempts since history since their last attempt. This allows the user to check the count they had and compare it to what happened. 
	- Upon completion of the snatch and clean and jerk session, a leaderboard will appear to show placings.
        - Upon completion of the competition, you can click either the Start or Reset Competition buttons. Start Competition will keep the name and openers the same. Reset Competition will reset athlete name and openers.
